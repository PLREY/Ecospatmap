            <blockquote> The degradation of climate and biodiversity are two major crises humans are facing and for which rapid action is needed. Both crises are partially linked and susceptible to threaten nature contribution to peoples (NCPs). Hence, it is essential to find efficient strategies to protect key areas for both biodiversity and NCPs for a sustainable future. Studies at various scales have already been proposed to identify the most suitable areas for combining NCPs and biodiversity as a trade-off, yet an evaluation of how changes in species distributions could affect NCPs is still lacking. Based on a recently established table of relationships between more than 2,000 vertebrate and tracheophyte species and 17 NCPs, we propose a novel approach to predict the spatial distribution of NCPs from individual species predictions for the present and four future time-scenarios in the Western Swiss Alps. We illustrate the new approach and how such assessment permits to better understand and anticipate the way species losses may lead to NCP losses, thus affecting human well-being. It thus has the potential to constitute a major new spatial planning tool for policy-makers and managers.</blockquote>
